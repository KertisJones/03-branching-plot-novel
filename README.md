# 03-Branching-plot-novel

Join King Arthur on his quest to cross The Bridge of Death in order to retrieve the fabled Holy Grail!
Can you pass the Bridgekeeper's test? 
Can you survive? 
Will you learn of the Bridgekeeper's favorite comedians and reenact their most famous sketch?
Discover the answers to all this and more in -- *THE BRIDGE OF DEATH*

--------------------------------------------

In all seriousness though, it's a "branching-plot novel" that lets you reenact two of the best comedy sketches of all
time. It utilizes functions, user input, and a dictionary.

Choose your adventure! This is the third programming assignment for ILS-Z399. The requirements for this assignment are as follows:

* Write a Python program for playing a simple "branching-plot novel" game
* A branching-plot novel is a work of fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making choices. The narrative branches along various paths, determined by the reader's choices. ([Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook) about branching-plot novels.)
* Present the player with a narrative segment and a series of choices
* Each of those choices branches to a new narrative segment
* Provide some happy and some sad endings

To get a perfect score, you will need to think creatively! Think about ways you can make this project more interesting or fun.

To complete this assignment you will need to understand:

* Python basic control structures like [if and else (and elif)](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/ifstatements.html)
* How to [compare](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/comparison_operators_example.htm) two values in Python
* How to [accept user input](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/io.html)
* How to create and call a [function](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions) in Python
* How to use the Python [dictionary](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/dictionary/how-to-use-dictionaries-in-python) data type
